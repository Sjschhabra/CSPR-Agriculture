## Abstract
Farming plays a crucial role in our economy, yet traditional methods often fail to meet the demands of modern agriculture. There is a pressing need for efficient technological advancements that are smart, cost-effective, durable, and capable of significantly increasing crop yield. This need inspired the development of a cable-suspended farming robot, dubbed "FarmPet." 

FarmPet utilizes a straightforward mechanism that allows the robot to hover over fields using multiple rope supports. The design employs calculus equations, software programming, and inverse kinematics to facilitate the movement of the central robot. By arranging at least four poles, each equipped with a stepper motor, cables are anchored to the motors and connected to the central robot, enabling it to traverse the field. 

The software algorithms allow the robot to move at a constant velocity along circular or straight-line paths by dynamically adjusting the cable lengths in coordination. The robot is designed to perform various agricultural tasks, including pesticide and insecticide application, seed spreading, field surveillance, and land mapping, all while avoiding contact with crops and minimizing disturbance to sensitive plants. Practical testing of the model demonstrated successful performance, with efficient calculations and functional algorithms.
